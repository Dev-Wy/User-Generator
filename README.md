## My Process
### Built with
- JavaScript
- Manipulate the DOM

### What I learned
- I learned how to use a selector option and enhanced my JavaScript skills. I also became familiar randomizing within JS functions.

### Continued development
- I would like to connect this to an API to select books from a list of genres choices. It would be an entertaing way for a reader to select their next book.
